Example for [Ember](http://emberjs.com) testing using [karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma) as a test runner for unit and integration testing, as well as [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) for building and development.

[Jasmine](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine) is used for the unit tests, while [QUnit](https://github.com/jquery/qunit) is used for integration testing.
